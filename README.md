Git Update Policies:
---------------
1. We only pull and push packages’ content under /src directory of each team member’s workstation folder in VM. 
   We will pull/push them from/to /Project_Packages at root directory under our project’s git page. 
   We should make sure our package folders under /src in our local machine are always synchronized with the remote git page's.

2. Never change or push CmakeLists.txt under your workstation/src to git.

3. All the other document or files that are not directly related to our project like README.md , Project DesignDocument, etc. will be pulled/pushed at root directory under our project’s git page.

4. Every time a team member modifies the content for any packages, he should make sure it can pass the catkin_make, and then add/commit/push them to our git page when he thinks the modification is big enough to generate a new commit version.

5. Always write down detailed message about what you have changed for each of your commit.

6. If there is a significant change on the whole architecture of our project, we may create a branch to develop it, and merge it when it is prooved to be better version than master's

Version Update Policies:
---------------------
1. All changes should be uploaded to the folder "Project_Packages" first.

2. The folder "Alpha_Release" will be our alpha release when we have an agreement. And after it is completed, it will not be changed anymore. 

3. So are the beta release and final release.
